## Building the Docs

To get started, you'll need a few things, you should have `pipenv` 
(or your favorite python container tool). And some familiarly with RST.

To begin, install the requirements into your python environment

```
pipenv install -r requirements.txt
pipenv shell
```

To make things easier, this project uses a build tool called make

To use it just run

```
make
```

Thats it! Make some edits, and then run `make html`
